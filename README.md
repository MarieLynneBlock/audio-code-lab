# Electronic Music Tools

Creative Computing projects focussed on Sound Design & Sound Synthesis: design new algorithmic patterns to generate both rhythmic (Drum Machines) and melodic music samples, code new interactive synthesizers and theremins and on top of it, build user-friendly and beautiful UIs to make the music tools available outside music environments and DAWs (web and mobile).

      - Algorithms for Sound Synthesis and Design 
      - Sound Synthesis
      - Web Audio API (synthesis graphs, User Input,...)
      - Oscillator Parameters & Modulation
      - Triggerable Envelopes
      - ...


## Environments, Languages & Frameworks used to create this repo


### Domain Specific Languages:

- __Alda__: A music programming language for musicians, runs on Java 8+.
visit [Alda on GitHub](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda).

- __ChucK__: audio programming language for real-time synthesis, composition, and performance. It is designed to favor readability and flexibility for the programmer over other considerations such as raw performance.

- __Csound__: audio DSL, written in C, based on the earlier system called Music 11.

- __Max/MSP__: visual programming language for music and multimedia. It has been used by composers, performers, software designers, researchers, and artists to create recordings, performances, and installations.

- __MUSIC-N Languages__: have very similar model behind them to the analogue synthesis model, where unit generators (modules) would be wired together effectively and programmatically into synthesis graphs, which generates sound.

- __Pure Data (Pd)__: visual programming language for creating interactive computer music and multimedia works. 


### Front-ends, IDEs and music composition environments:

- __Bipscript__: a simple programming environment for creating music.

- __CodeCircle__ (Goldsmiths University): browser based software development environment developed by Goldsmiths University, as well as a social environment to collaborate with other coders and musicians.  
                  \[*JavaScript*]  
               
- __EarSketch__  (Georgia Tech): web-based music, composition and remix environment that comprises different elements: DAW, code editor, console and a sound browser.
(The sound library was created by Young Guru and Richard Devine)
                  \[*JavaScript, Python*]

- __SuperCollider__: platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition, used by musicians, artists, and researchers working with sound existing out of 3 major components: scsynth, a real-time audio server; sclang, an interpreted programming language; scide, an editor for sclang.
                  

### General Languages, music libraries, frameworks:

- __LADSPA__: "Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API" is an API standard for handling audio filters and audio signal processing effects Framework. LADSPA exists primarily as a header file written in C.

- __VST__: software interface that integrates software audio synthesizer and effect plugins with audio editors and recording systems. VST and similar technologies use digital signal processing to simulate traditional recording studio hardware in software.
